# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This project focuses on understanding and practicing the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It will help developers create clear, structured documentation to plan and build software systems successfully.

The main goal is to practice identifying and writing down the needs of a software project before starting to code. This is a very important step that helps save time, avoid mistakes, and make sure everyone understands what needs to be built.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of finding out what a software system needs to do.

It involves talking to users, clients, or stakeholders to understand their needs. Then, those needs are written down clearly so developers and designers can build the system correctly.

It is the **first step** in the software development process. If this step is done well, the rest of the project becomes much easier.

This step helps make sure:
- Everyone understands what needs to be built
- No important features are forgotten
- The final software meets the user's goals
