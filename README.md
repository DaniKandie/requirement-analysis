# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This project focuses on understanding and practicing the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It will help developers create clear, structured documentation to plan and build software systems successfully.

The main goal is to practice identifying and writing down the needs of a software project before starting to code. This is a very important step that helps save time, avoid mistakes, and make sure everyone understands what needs to be built.
