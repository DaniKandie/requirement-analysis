# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This project focuses on understanding and practicing the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It will help developers create clear, structured documentation to plan and build software systems successfully.

The main goal is to practice identifying and writing down the needs of a software project before starting to code. This is a very important step that helps save time, avoid mistakes, and make sure everyone understands what needs to be built.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of finding out what a software system needs to do.

It involves talking to users, clients, or stakeholders to understand their needs. Then, those needs are written down clearly so developers and designers can build the system correctly.

It is the **first step** in the software development process. If this step is done well, the rest of the project becomes much easier.

This step helps make sure:
- Everyone understands what needs to be built
- No important features are forgotten
- The final software meets the user's goals

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is important because:

1. **It avoids confusion**
   - When everyone agrees on what needs to be built, there‚Äôs less chance of misunderstanding.

2. **It saves time and money**
   - It is cheaper and easier to fix mistakes early (on paper) than later (in code).

3. **It helps build the right product**
   - The team builds a system that actually solves the user‚Äôs problem, not just what they think the user needs.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Here are the 5 main activities involved in requirement analysis:

- **Requirement Gathering**
  - Collect information from users, clients, or stakeholders about what they need from the system.

- **Requirement Elicitation**
  - Ask the right questions through interviews, surveys, or workshops to get clear requirements.

- **Requirement Documentation**
  - Write down all the requirements in a clear and structured format that everyone can understand.

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Organize the requirements into categories and use diagrams (like use case diagrams) to visualize how the system should work.

- **Requirement Validation**
  - Review the requirements with users and team members to make sure everything is correct and complete.
